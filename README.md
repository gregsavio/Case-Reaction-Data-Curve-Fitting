# Case-Reaction-Data-Curve-Fitting
The attached case was provided by my lecturer for the final exam. In this case, I was tasked with determining the coefficients of a non-elementary hydrogenation reaction by using SSE method. The coefficients obtained is used for calculating reaction rate data. Afterwards, the data obtained from equation is fitted to experimental data.
